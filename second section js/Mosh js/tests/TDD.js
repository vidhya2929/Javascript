// TDD => Test Driven DEvelopment
//  start with test and then we produce the application code

// 3 step cycle
// 1) Start by writing a failing test
// 2) Write just enough code to make the test pass
// 3) Refactor if necessary


// started by writing test and as a result we produced the function

// Also it produces code that is 100% covered by tests.
