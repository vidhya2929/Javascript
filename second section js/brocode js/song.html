            We don't talk anymore
            We don't talk anymore
            We don't talk anymore
            Like we used to do
            We don't love anymore
            What was all of it for?

            Oh, we don't talk anymore
            Like we used to do
            I just heard you found the one you've been looking
            You've been looking for
            I wish I would have known that wasn't me
            'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder
            Why I can't move on
            Just the way you did so easily
            Don't wanna know
            Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
            If he's holding onto you so tight
            The way I did before
            I overdosed
            Should've known your love was a game
            Now I can't get you out of my brain
            Oh, it's such a shame
            That we don't talk anymore
            We don't talk anymore
            We don't talk anymore
            Like we used to do
            We don't love anymore
            What was all of it for?

            Oh, we don't talk anymore
            Like we used to do
            I just hope you're lying next to somebody
            Who knows how to love you like me
            There must be a good reason that you're gone
            Every now and then I think you might want me to
            Come show up at your door
            But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
            Don't wanna know
            If you're looking into her eyes
            If she's holding onto you so tight
            The way I did before
            I overdosed
            Should've known your love was a game
            Now I can't get you out of my brain
            Oh, it's such a shame
            That we don't talk anymore
            We don't talk anymore
            We don't talk anymore
            Like we used to do
            We don't love anymore
            What was all of it for?

            Oh, we don't talk anymore
            Like we used to do
            Like we used to do
            Don't wanna know
            Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
            If he's giving it to you just right
            The way I did before
            I overdosed
            Should've known your love was a game
            Now I can't get you out of my brain
            Oh, it's such a shame
            That we don't talk anymore
            We don't talk anymore
            We don't talk anymore
            Like we used to do
            We don't love anymore
            What was all of it for?

            Oh, we don't talk anymore
            Like we used to do
            We don't talk anymore (don't wanna know)
            Kind of dress you're wearing tonight (oh)
            If he's holding onto you so tight (oh)
            The way I did before
            We don't talk anymore (I overdosed)
            Should've known your love was a game (oh)
            Now I can't get you out of my brain (whoa)
            Oh, it's such a shame
